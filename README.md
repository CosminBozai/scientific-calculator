# Scientific calculator

Scientific calulator I made for my web developer project portofolio. 

## Features:

### Dynamic result evaluation
The app evaluates and displays the result as the user is inputing the values. 

### Custom error
If an error occurs, instead of a result the user will get an error message describing the problem.

### Past calcualtions storage
The calculator stores and displays the past calculations made by the user.

### Undo functionality
The user can undo the calculations made.

### Responsive design

## Main dependencies that the calculator uses: 

### 1. Typescript
I use Typescript in this project as type-checking is very important on this kind of app where data is received from and modified by both user and external libraries.

### 2. SASS
On this app I used SASS to handle the styling part.

### 3. mathjs
Mathjs is the core dependency of this app. I use the library's math.evaluate() function to evaluate the input from the user.

### 4. Jotai
I use Jotai for global state management as it's a very lightweight and easy to use library that is perfect for a small app like this one.

### Other dependencies: 
- Vite
- better-react-mathjax
